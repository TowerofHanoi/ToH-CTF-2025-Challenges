> Hey, my cousin lent me this Wii game we used to play together when we were kids. It was really cool because the developers also sold custom SD cards with additional cards to be added to the game. Man those were the days. Anyway I heard on Reddit that you can use it to install the Homebrew Channel. Anyone know how to do that?

**Goal**: get the contents of `/sys/flag` in system NAND
**Remote**: Dolphin 2506a emulator on Linux. The build has been patched to enable the use of networking in TAS (so you can provide us input). The patch is included in the attachments.

You will be able to upload your SD card files and and a TAS recording. You will not be given access to the screen and no screenshots will be made.

You are advised to use the same build on the same OS to avoid problems. Dolphin networking may encounter some issues on Windows. The web server used by the game in localhost is provided as a "dummy" server that the game could have used in its intended functionality, but has not bearing on the challenge.
