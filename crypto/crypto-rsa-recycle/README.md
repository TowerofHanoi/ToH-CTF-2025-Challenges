# crypto-rsa-recycle

## Context

Fed up with the amount of energy wasted in training LLMs, just to ask them the number of 'r's in strawberry, we decided to have our own take in helping the environment.

Therefore, we chose to send our message to two different recipients, while recycling part of an RSA key, after all, they know each other, and they said they don't mind.

We are *absolutely, positively, totally certain* that there's no issue in this.
