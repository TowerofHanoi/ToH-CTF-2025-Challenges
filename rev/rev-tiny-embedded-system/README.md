# Tiny Embedded System

We've all been there. You just bought a new shiny gadget and the first
thing that comes to mind is to dump its firmware and see if you can find
something interesting.
This time you'll have the chance to do it with a clear purpose: find the
flag that's somewhere in there. What's more, you'll be able to pick the
embedded system flavor you're more comfortable with: Linux, RTOS or bare
metal. Choose more than one if you're a pro.

This is the bare metal challenge.

NOTE: Flag is not in the standard format, { and } are missing. Flag is all lowercase.
Add the parenthesis in the final flag.

## Hint \#1

Connect a piezo speaker to PC0 and PD5, press the button on PA1 and listen to the flag
