Hey guys. So, I was digging around in my basement and found this super old GBA game from when I was a kid. Total nostalgia trip. BUT, here's the problem: I canâ€™t find the manual, and it had the instructions for the anti-piracy check. ðŸ˜­ Tried to fire it up on my GBA, but it ain't budging. Anyone know how to get past this? Iâ€™ve got the ROM file here if anyone wants to take a look. Help an old gamer out!
