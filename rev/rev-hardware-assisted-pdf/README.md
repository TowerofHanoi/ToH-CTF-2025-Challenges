# Description

So, PDFs are Turing complete and can run Doom. In fact, [they can even run Linux](https://github.com/ading2210/linuxpdf). I was thinking that we could make them check flags too.
The checker might freeze sometimes, but it's not a bug, it's a feature, otherwise how could you get it printed?
